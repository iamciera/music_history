## Music History 

This list serves as several functions 1. started as a way to track my favorite albums of the year  2. I have a bad memory, this is an attempt to keep track of new music 3. This is my answer to the very difficult question "What kind of music do you listen to?".

The only rating I give is LOVE or nothing, which is listed in a seperate list at the bottom of each year. 

Music suggestions are appreciated. 

## About Data

From 2012 & 2013: Only listed by favorite albums of the year.

2014 to June 15, 2016: Only listed albums that I listened to that were released that year.  

June 15, 2016 - present: In an attempt to keep track of albums that *are new to me*, no matter the year, I started listing all albums. I specify the year in parenthesis if the album was not a recent release.

**bold** = albums I have not listened to, but want to.

\* = note to listen again
